I'm greatly interested in studying a myriad bunch of topics like active galactic nucleis, dark matter and cosmology. Previously, I completed my Backelors and Masters degrees in Physics from Presidency University, Kolkata, India. My alternative interests include following soccer, hiking and reading up on history.
